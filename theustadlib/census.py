"""Test census: a green exit code is not evidence that the tests ran.

A verifier's exit code can be produced without executing anything the
acceptance suite asserts.  Two ways, both from source files an agent is
meant to edit and which protection therefore cannot see:

* a module-level ``pytest.skip`` in code the protected tests import, which
  removes them from collection while other tests keep the run green; and
* ``os._exit(0)`` on import, which ends the process with status 0 before a
  single assertion runs.

The census records which tests the acceptance suite collected *before* the
agent started, then requires the verification run to account for every one
of them in a structured report written outside the repository.
